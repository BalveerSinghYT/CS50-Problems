# My daily progress on CS50 course.
This is my working log file where I will be update what I'm doing just to keep track my progress & for self motivation.

### Day1: October 10, 2020 (Solving pset3/plurality)
I read the problem set & tried to solve the problem.

### Day2: October 11, 2020 (Solving pset3/plurality)
This problem is easy to solve & 80% problem is sloved. I'm just one step away from the final testing.

### Day3: October 12, 2020 (Solving pset3/plurality)
I thought it would be easy, but there is a twist. Still can't figure out how to print all the names of candidates if votes are the same. 

### Day4: October 14, 2020 (Solving pset3/plurality)
This problem was very easy & it took me almost 5 days to solve. But I do't know why I was not able to solve it before. Today just got idea & solved the same problem in 10min.

### Day5: October 16, 2020 (Solving pset3/runoff)
Today I started with runoff & understood its concept briefly.

### Day6: October 17, 2020 (Solving pset3/runoff)
I implemented one function out of six called Vote. This function generally validates the name of the candidate & updates it to the global preference array.
